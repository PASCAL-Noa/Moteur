# ⚙️ Engine – My first 3D game engine with DirectX12 !⚡

This game engine, fully developed in C++ using DirectX12, is built around an optimized Entity Component System (ECS) and a script management system inspired by Unity, providing solid performance and flexibility. \
The complete encapsulation of DirectX12 ensures efficient and clean rendering, enhanced by a particle system and real-time dynamic lighting. \
The engine also supports .obj model loading and texture mapping, allowing for the creation of detailed and immersive 3D environments.
